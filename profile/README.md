Users of Honey Finance can:

- borrow tokens against their NFTs
- vote on governance proposals with veHONEY
- more coming soon...


## Contributing/Building

The Honey Finance protocol is completely open source and transparant so the community can be involved while we build.<br />
Honey Finance aims to teach individuals about DeFi and create an army of builders that onboard the next billion users into crypto.<br />
Honey Finance incentivises people to build open source code for everyone to leverage.<br />
